# Overview

A boy is called to be a hero, except the call came too late. The boy is now
eighty-six and dying. All his life experiences will enable him to overcome or
subvert the challenges ahead.

He has been called all his life, but not just for this journey. He was called to
have a family, to serve his country, to help a friend in need. He needed all of
those journeys to be able to take on this last one.
