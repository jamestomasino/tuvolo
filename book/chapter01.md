## Chapter 1

On the night Tuvolo died, he had a dream.

He was standing on a great white cliff overlooking rolling hills of snow and
pine. His nostrils itched. His breath froze. There was a deepness to this
chill that went beyond the wind.

Far away a river cut through the land, leading ever onward. Moonlight reflecting
on snow and ice cast an omnipresent glow of unreality. Or perhaps that was just
the dream.

It was familiar though he knew he'd never been here. The Norals, perhaps, far in the east? Had he read about them? Maybe a story from the war. It was important and not, like his desire to look at himself.

He stood, and that for the first time in years. To look down would be to confirm
this was a dream, that he did not have real working limbs, that his body was
imagination and hope. So he refused. Better to live this moment in falsehood
than to demand the reality of pain.

The feeling was there, though. The cold, so cold. His knees felt the ache long
familiar of seasons changing, of rain approaching, of a bad Sunday morning. How
could he feel those things in a dream so vividly? Perhaps that was the lie.
Maybe his mind was just pretending to feel them. Is there any difference? If
your mind tells you there's pain then the pain is real. Pain isn't real, it's in
the mind. That was definitely a thought from the war.

A step, then. To stand is one thing, simple. You can be propped up, after all.
Crutches had served him that way. Leaned against a familiar stone by younger men
eager to go and do things. Like a rake or spade unneeded, put away. But to move
under one's own power--

Snow covered his feet.
