## Chapter 2 - The Escape

Gunshots peppered endlessly in the background, a staccato rhythm that blended
with the never-ending rain. It drummed into your soul, ten thousand tiny strikes
an hour. Tuvolo imagined his heart had learned to beat along with it.
Patter-patter-tut-tut-tut. His blood moved to the sounds of war, remaking him
a little bit with each pump.

A sergeant bellowed, as sergeants are wont to do. Like the bleating of sheep, or
howling of wolves, it was a primal noise of that species regardless of which
army or age. This bellow was important somehow, and Tuvolo's ears attuned to it
reflexively despite not knowing the language. This noise was about him. They'd
discovered he was missing.

Six of them lay in the mud, buried to their noses in muck. Seval, eyes dark.
Benadot, with the flaming hair. Mercalo, who spoke like a scholar and knew the
names of all the trees. Astrig, who never missed. Rendal, too soft for this life
but too lucky to leave it. And Tuvolo, the swift.

The mud was Mercalo's plan. "We're not as fast as you, Tuvolo. The mud sucks our
feet down. We must trick them, let them run beyond us chasing shadows."

Seval wanted to lay traps, to take as many of them as possible. "Bastards,
bastards," Seval muttered in time with the rain, until the mud blocked the
words.

Silence was not possible in the jungle, but if Tuvolo listened very, very hard,
he could almost make it out under the rhythms of war. It called to him from very
far away, but his attention must be here. The guns approached, and with them
a sound far worse. Dogs.

Their howls were the screaming winter winds and Tuvolo's footsteps faltered in
the snow. No, mud. Mud that tried to grab his ankles while Rendal's strangled
cries grabbing his heart.
